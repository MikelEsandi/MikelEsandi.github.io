Description of the different projects:

- FINANCIAL SCRIPTS:

1. Reversion_Estocastica_Tipos:
   Simulation of a stochastic mean-reversion model for short-term interest rates.
   For a reversion model with a constant mean, we estimate by simulation the discount factors per month for the next 10 years.
   For a more complex model with changing means, we estimate by simulation the probability of negative rate in 4 years and calculate the sample standard deviation.
